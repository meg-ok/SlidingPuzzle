"This weeks quiz will be to create and implement a sliding puzzle.
The puzzle must be playable from keyboard input. The program will
generate a puzzle in a random configuration and the puzzle generated
must be solvable. You may create either the 8-puzzle or the 15-puzzle."

The solution chooses to use mouse input rather than keyboard input --
using the mouse seemed easier from a user perspective. It is an
8-puzzle, but can be easily modified to be any size.
